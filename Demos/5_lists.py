# list comprehension

# create a list with 1-100

#manually type it out
# a = [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]

# for loop 
# a = []
# for i in range(1,101):
#     a.append(i)
# print(a)

# list comprehension method
# a = [i for i in range(1,101)]
# print(a)

# # list of 1-100 perfect squares
# b = [i*i for i in range(1,101)]
# print(b)

# c = [i*i for i in b]
# print(c)


# fast type casting
d = ['1','2','3','4','5'] #this is a typical input
print(d)
d = [int(k) for k in d]
print(d)
